"9106562109","Stephen Harper","Today I’m in Montreal preparing for tomorrow’s Leader’s debate.  As I reflect on the last seven weeks of travelling across the country and meeting Canadians it’s remarkable how everywhere I go, people are saying the same things. They’re concerned about global economic instability.  They want to know that their job or their business and most of all their families, will be protected. 
 
That’s why our plan to protect our economy is so important.  Our plan will create jobs.  In fact, as I announced yesterday in Winnipeg, our goal is to create another 1.3 million new jobs in Canada by the year 2020.  
 
And our plan gives taxpayers peace of mind because a Conservative government will not raise taxes.  Canadians work hard to make ends meet, and we know that  your money belongs to you, not politicians or bureaucrats in Ottawa. That’s why we’ve lowered taxes why we will keep them low.  We can promise low taxes because we only make promises we can afford,  we spend prudently, and we’ll maintain our balanced budgets. 
 
The other guys have made a lot of promises in this campaign, but it always boils down to this: they will take more money out of your pocket and off your paycheque. They will spend billions more than we can afford and expose our fragile economy at a time of global economic uncertainty.  That is not the way to move Canada’s economy forward. That is not the way to ensure our continued prosperity.
 
The choices on October 19th could not be more different and there’s a lot to think about.  Every single vote is going to count.  I’ll be working hard over the next 26 days to meet as many Canadians as possible and talk about our plan to protect our economy by creating jobs, lowering taxes and maintaining our budgets balanced.  –SH","2015-09-23T22:00:01+0000","status",NA,"9106562109_10153535720687110",2606,342,556

"9106562109","Stephen Harper","On this historic 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, we pay tribute to the brave Canadian, British, and other allied heroes who risked their lives to defend democracy and freedom against Nazi forces.

The Battle of Britain was significant for a number of reasons, including that it was the first campaign fought entirely by air forces, victory occurred despite the fact that allied forces were greatly outnumbered, and it was the first major defeat of Nazi forces in the Second World War. It also marked the Royal Canadian Air Force’s first combat commitment during World War II.

Between July and October 1940, more than one hundred Canadians flew in the Battle, 23 of whom tragically lost their lives.

As Canadians remember the courage and success of those who served at the Battle of Britain, let us also express gratitude to our men and women in uniform who continue to serve and protect our freedom, democracy, values and way of life.

Lest We Forget.

"9106562109","Stephen Harper","Single and widowed seniors can face unique financial challenges.
 
Our seniors have worked hard and saved their entire lives, and our Conservative Party knows that they are best able to make decisions about their future and retirement. Already, we’ve made changes that have taken about 400,000 seniors completely off the tax rolls. And there is more to do.
 
Today, we are announcing a $2,000 “equivalent-to-spouse” Pension Income Credit (PIC) that will help nearly 1.6 million single Canadian seniors. When combined with the existing PIC, it will mean up to $600 in tax relief every year. 
 
The Liberals and NDP have a clear record of opposing the initiatives we have put forward to support older Canadians. Their unaffordable promises will mean higher taxes and less money for seniors struggling to make ends meet. Instead of creating expensive programs that will hike their taxes even higher, our low-tax Conservative plan helps them keep more of their money to spend on the priorities they choose.
 
On October 19, vote Conservative to protect our economy.

Today Finance Canada confirmed, that under our Conservative government’s careful economic stewardship, we balanced the budget a full year early with almost a $2 billion surplus in 2014-15. We’ve accomplished this while lowering taxes, increasing benefits for families, and investing in infrastructure.

Now, we need to keep moving our economy forward.

A balanced budget is the foundation of our economic plan. With it, we can continue to lower taxes and invest in Canadian families.

The alternative is clear – both the Liberals and NDP would run deficits and hike taxes on Canadians. This would expose our fragile economy to the global uncertainty all around us.

In 2011, in recognition of the importance of such bravery and selflessness, Canada designated September 11th as our National Day of Service.

I told Kevin and Marge the same thing I’m telling you: a Conservative Government will not raise your taxes. 

With our plan, you keep your monthly child care cheques and income splitting for families and seniors.

Those benefits mean more money for your family, and because we balanced the federal budget, you can count on them for the next four years.

It’s Wednesday, October the 14th. There are just 5 days left in this campaign.

I’m asking for your support to keep your taxes low: http://cpcp.cc/Ad51Yr","2015-10-14T14:15:00+0000","link","https://soundcloud.com/cpc_pcc/october-14","9106562109_10153572590337110",1422,95,420
