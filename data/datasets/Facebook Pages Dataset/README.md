## 1. The Facebook Pages Dataset

This data set contains strictly structured data on every post published to the three verified public Facebook pages in this repository. Data range from August 4th until October 19th, 2015, consisting of every post published to Facebook during this time (N = 1,711).

This data set contains six fields of structured data; namely, id, type, created_time, likes_count, comments_count, and shares_count. The latter three fields record the total number of likes, comments, and shares that each post recieved on Facebook during the 2015 election campaign.

This data set will be useful to researchers interested in gaging how well a candidate's campaign performed on Facebook. For example, the data demonstrates the popularity of each candidates' online campaign based on overall engagement (i.e., number of likes, shares, and/or comments recieved from Facebook users over time).
