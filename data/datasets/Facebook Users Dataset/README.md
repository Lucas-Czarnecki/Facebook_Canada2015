## 3. The Facebook Users Dataset

This data set is a collection of Facebook user responses to campaign messages from candidates published to Facebook during the election. Data consist of comments published to Facebook between August 4th and October 19th, 2015. The data set contains many of the same fields as the two previous data sets. The message column returns the text-based comments that Facebook users published in response to candidatesâ€™ campaign messages during the 2015 election campaign.

This data set will be of interest to researchers looking to study campaign effects online.
