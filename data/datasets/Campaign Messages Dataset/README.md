## The Campaign Messages Dataset

This  data set includes party leadersâ€™ text-based Facebook posts (n = 1,530). The data queried in this dataset consists of many of the same variables found in the Facebook Pages Dataset; including, created_time, from_id, and id. More importantly, it contains a field called message, which records UTF-8 encoded text data on every campaign message published to Facebook. Posts that did not contain any text data (after preprocessing) were removed from this dataset.

This data set will be useful to researchers interested in studying campaign messaging or those wishing to conduct a text analysis on these data.
